ONAV - A Responsive Top/Side Navigation with Pure CSS.
Demo: https://codepen.io/hiworldjs/pen/PePWYg

Not being able to find a suitable sample code for a legacy top menu that becomes a sidebar in phone screens, I decided to make one myself.

Since Javascript is overkilled, I created a CSS toggle with checkbox+label and armed it with some smooth CSS3 animations for the eyes.

Feel free to download the code and try yourself.

Cheers,
Harry
